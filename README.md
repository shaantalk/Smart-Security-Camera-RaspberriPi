# Smart Security Camera RaspberriPi


This is a Raspberry Pi project build on Pi Zero. Here I compare frames of video feed to find a moving object and then I use OpenCV models to figure that the moving object is a human or not.


If the moving object is a human then the code will send a mail with a picture of the human to the user.


I have used flask framework for this project
